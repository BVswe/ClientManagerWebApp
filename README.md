# ClientManagerWebApp
Web application to manage clients of a business. Intended to be hosted only on a local network, not on the internet.
Be sure to have an existing Postgres database and to change the database strings in appsettings.json
DBSetup should use your user id and the default database.
Default should use client_manager_db as the database instead.
